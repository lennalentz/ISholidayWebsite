        I really can't stay - Baby it's cold <span class="highlight">outside</span>
        I've got to go away - Baby it's cold <span style="color: aliceblue;">outside</span>
        This evening has been - Been hoping that you'd drop in
        So very nice - I'll hold your hands, they're just like ice
        My mother will start to worry - Beautiful, what's your hurry
        My father will be pacing the floor - Listen to the fireplace roar
        So really I'd better scurry - Beautiful, please don't hurry
        Well Maybe just a half a drink more - Put some music on while I pour
    </p>
    <p>
        The neighbors might think - Baby, it's bad out there
        Say, what's in this drink - No cabs to be had out there
        I wish I knew how - Your eyes are like starlight now
        To break this spell - I'll take your hat, your hair looks swell
        I ought to say no, no, no, sir - Mind if I move a little closer
        At least I'm gonna say that I tried - What's the sense in hurting my pride
        I really can't stay - Baby don't hold out
        Ahh, but it's cold outside
    </p>
    <p>
        C'mon baby
    </p>    
    <p class="mygreen">
        I simply must go - Baby, it's cold outside
        The answer is no - Ooh baby, it's cold outside
        This welcome has been - I'm lucky that you dropped in
        So nice and warm -- Look out the window at that storm
        My sister will be suspicious - Man, your lips look so delicious
        My brother will be there at the door - Waves upon a tropical shore
        My maiden aunt's mind is vicious - Gosh your lips look delicious
        Well maybe just a half a drink more - Never such a blizzard before
    </p>
    <p>
        I've got to go home - Oh, baby, you'll freeze out there
        Say, lend me your comb - It's up to your knees out there
        You've really been grand - Your eyes are like starlight now
        But don't you see - How can you do this thing to me
        There's bound to be talk tomorrow - Making my life long sorrow
        At least there will be plenty implied - If you caught pneumonia and died
        I really can't stay - Get over that old out
        Ahh, but it's cold outside
    </p>
    <p>
        Baby it's cold outside
    </p>
    <p>
        Brr its cold...
        It's cold out there
        Cant you stay awhile longer baby
        Well... I really shouldn't... alright
    </p>
    <p>
        Make it worth your while baby
        Ahh, do that again...
    </p>
